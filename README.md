# walls - a collection of nice looking desktop backgrounds!

Each category in this folder is a git submodule, so you don't have to fetch every category, such as anime or landscapes

To add a submodule, use `git submodule add [REMOTE URL]`.
To download a specific set of wallpapers, you can use `git submodule update [name of submodule]`

So far, the categories of wallpapers are:

* Abstract
* Anime
* Landscapes
